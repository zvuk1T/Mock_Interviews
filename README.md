The word “mock” comes from the Old French word “mocquer” which means "to jeer or scoff at." It was later borrowed into Middle English with the same meaning. In the context of mock interviews, the term “mock” implies that these interviews simulate real job interviews for practice purposes but are not actual interviews. Essentially, it's a way to prepare and practice without the real-world stakes.
